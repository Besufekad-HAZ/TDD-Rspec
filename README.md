<!-- Features -->

## Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- RSpec: A testing framework for Ruby that provides a clear and concise domain-specific language for writing tests and assertions.

- Continuous Integration: Automatically runs tests every time new code is committed to catch bugs and errors early in the development process.

- Code Coverage: Measures how much of the codebase is exercised by the tests to ensure thorough testing of all parts of the code.

- Mocking and Stubbing: Techniques used to simulate external dependencies or objects that are difficult to test, making it easier to test edge cases and error conditions.
